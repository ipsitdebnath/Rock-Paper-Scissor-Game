# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

This project is a browser based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game developed using JavaScript, along with basic HTML for displaying results. The objective of the project is to simulate a simple interactive game where a user plays against the computer.

The player enters their move, choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissor, through a prompt input. The computer generates its move randomly using the Math.random() function, ensuring unpredictability in each round. Conditional statements are used to compare the player’s choice with the computer’s choice and determine the outcome as a win, loss, or tie.

The game runs for multiple rounds using a loop, allowing repeated gameplay without refreshing the page. After each round, the selected moves and the result are displayed dynamically on the webpage by updating specific HTML elements using Document Object Model manipulation techniques such as getElementById and innerText.

This project demonstrates the practical application of core JavaScript concepts including variables, loops, conditional statements, random number generation, user input handling, and dynamic content updates. It also strengthens understanding of basic game logic and interactive web development fundamentals.

Overall, the project provides hands on experience in building a simple yet functional browser based game while reinforcing programming logic and front end development skills.
